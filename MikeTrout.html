            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Michael Nelson Trout (born August 7, 1991) is an American professional baseball center fielder for the Los Angeles Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB). Trout is an eight-time MLB All-Star, three-time American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) (winning the award in 2014, 2016, and 2019, while finishing second in the 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2018 votes), and is a seven-time winner of the Silver Slugger Award. He is nicknamed "the Millville Meteor."
            </p>
            <h2>Comparisons</h2>
            <p>
                Trout's exceptional performance at an early age has drawn comparisons with Ted Williams, and his combination of power and speed to the skillset of Hall of Fame center fielder Mickey Mantle.
            </p>
            <h2>Notable Stats</h2>
            <p>

As of 2019, he led all active major league ballplayers in career slugging percentage (.581) and on base plus slugging (1.000), and was second in career on base percentage (.419) and stolen base percentage (84.75%).
